## Overview
The Dice Is Right is a multiplayer javascript game where you and up to 3 other players can verse each other to see who can reach 30 points first. Each turn starts with a player rolling the dice and having the result added to their total. If the player rolls the same number two or three times in a row, the score will be multiplied by that amount before being added to the total making doubles and triples almost necessity in winning. If you roll a 1 however, your points will be reset back to 0 so be careful!
